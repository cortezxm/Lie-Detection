# Lie Detection Using Facial Recognition 🤖

This project aims to detect potential deception through facial recognition and machine learning techniques. By analyzing facial expressions and employing advanced models, it seeks to provide insights into a person's truthfulness.

## 📌 Description
In this project, we use **transfer learning** and **LSTM** networks to analyze facial expressions and detect potential lies. The system is trained on a dataset of facial images and expressions to recognize patterns associated with deception. I specifically utilize the **InceptionV3** model for feature extraction.

The dataset is sourced from the **Real-Life Deception Detection** project by Mohamed Abouelenien at the University of Michigan. It consists of real-life trial videos featuring statements made by exonerees and defendants during crime-related TV episodes. The video clips are labeled as deceptive or truthful based on a guilty verdict, not-guilty verdict, and exoneration. The project utilizes video recordings taken in natural settings and applies multimodal approaches for deception detection, providing valuable visual and linguistic patterns to discriminate between liars and truth-tellers.
